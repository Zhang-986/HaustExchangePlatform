> Hi there! üëã I'm a Java backend developer currently working as a monitoring/listener intern in Hangzhou. This is my hands-on learning project where I explore fascinating monitoring technologies and build something practical for the HAUST (Henan University of Science and Technology) community.

**About Me:** I'm deeply passionate about modern monitoring and listening technologies in Java ecosystems. This project represents my journey into event-driven architectures, asynchronous processing, and real-time monitoring systems - technologies that truly excite me! üî•

## What Does This Platform Do? ü§î

This is an internal referral code sharing platform for HAUST students, designed to help with job hunting and experience sharing:

*   **Referral Information Hub:**
    *   Post and discover internal referral codes and job opportunities from various companies.
    *   Track your published referrals in the personal center.
    *   (Admin feature): Review and moderate submitted referrals to ensure quality.
*   **Community Discussion Forum:**
    *   A forum for posting about job hunting, asking questions, and sharing experiences.
    *   Support for comments, likes, and community engagement.
    *   Anonymous posting available.
*   **AI Intelligent Assistant (Experimental ‚ú®):**
    *   Integrated with Dify large language model API for recruitment-related Q&A.
    *   Implemented using WebFlux for streaming responses - pretty cool!

## Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è

As a monitoring/listener enthusiast, I've focused on implementing robust event-driven and monitoring patterns:

*   **Backend Core:**
    *   **Spring Boot (2.7.6):** The foundation for building this web application.
    *   **MyBatis:** For database operations with straightforward SQL control.
    *   **MySQL:** Primary data storage.
    *   **Redis:** Caching layer for likes, user info, and frequently accessed data.
    *   **RabbitMQ:** üéØ **Message queue for asynchronous task processing** - This is where the magic happens! Used for sensitive content monitoring notifications and user behavior tracking.
    *   **Spring Security / JWT:** Authentication and authorization.
    *   **Knife4j:** API documentation generator.
*   **Frontend (`haust-frontend/` directory):**
    *   **Vue 3:** Progressive JavaScript framework with Composition API
    *   **TypeScript:** Type-safe development
    *   **Vite:** Next-generation frontend build tool
    *   **Vue Router 4:** Official routing library
    *   **Pinia:** State management for Vue 3
    *   **Axios:** Promise-based HTTP client
    *   **Element Plus:** Vue 3 UI component library
    *   **SockJS + STOMP:** WebSocket communication for real-time chat
*   **Development Environment:**
    *   JDK 8
    *   Maven
    *   Node.js 16+

## Technical Highlights (What I Find Fascinating!) üí°

### üéØ RabbitMQ Message Listeners
As someone passionate about monitoring technologies, implementing message listeners has been incredibly rewarding! The system uses RabbitMQ to handle asynchronous events:

```java
// User behavior monitoring listener
@RabbitListener(
    bindings = @QueueBinding(
        value = @Queue(value = MqQueueConstant.USER_MONITOR_QUEUE, durable = "true"),
        exchange = @Exchange(value = MqExchangeConstant.USER_MONITOR_EXCHANGE, type = ExchangeTypes.TOPIC),
        key = MqKeyConstant.USER_MONITOR_KEY
    )
)
public void userInfoListener(UserMsg userMsg) {
    if(BeanUtil.isEmpty(userMsg)) return;
    userService.addMonitor(userMsg);
}
```

**Why this excites me:** RabbitMQ listeners enable decoupled, scalable architectures. The ability to monitor user activities asynchronously without blocking the main application flow is fascinating!

### üîç AOP-Based Sensitive Content Monitoring
Using Aspect-Oriented Programming for content monitoring keeps the code clean and maintainable:

```java
// Annotation-driven sensitive content monitoring
@SensitiveMonitor(ContentType.sharing)
@Override
public void addInfo(CodingSharingDTO codingSharingDTO) {
    // ... business logic executes safely after monitoring check ...
}
```

**The monitoring aspect intercepts method calls:**
```java
@Around("sensitiveMonitorPointcut()")
public Object aroundSensitiveMonitor(ProceedingJoinPoint joinPoint) throws Throwable {
    log.info("Sensitive content monitoring engaged");
    // Extract content based on type
    // Use IK Analyzer for word segmentation
    // Check against Bloom Filter for sensitive words
    // Throw exception if sensitive content detected
    return joinPoint.proceed();
}
```

**Why this is interesting:** AOP provides a non-invasive way to add monitoring and validation logic. It's a powerful pattern for cross-cutting concerns!

### ü§ñ AI Chatbot with Reactive Streams
First time integrating a large language model API (Dify) with WebFlux for streaming responses:

```java
// Using Project Reactor to handle streaming data
difyApiUtil.streamChat(text, userId, null)
    .doOnNext(chunk -> log.info("Received chunk: [{}]", chunk))
    // ... additional stream processing ...
    .block(); // Get complete result when needed
```

**Why I love this:** Reactive programming with streaming responses opens up a whole new world of possibilities. Watching AI responses flow in real-time is genuinely cool!

### ‚ö° Batch Processing for Likes
To prevent database overload from rapid-fire likes (future-proofing for scale!), I implemented a simple batch processing queue:

```java
@Component
public class BatchProcessUtil {
    // Scheduled task processes queue every 5 seconds
    @PostConstruct
    private void start() {
        scheduledExecutorService.scheduleWithFixedDelay(
            this::consume, 0, 5, TimeUnit.SECONDS
        );
    }
    
    // Queue like messages for batch processing
    public void process(LikeMsg msg) {
        blockingQueue.offer(msg);
    }
}
```

**Why this matters:** This pattern demonstrates how to handle high-frequency events efficiently - a crucial skill for monitoring systems!

## Project Architecture üèóÔ∏è

Classic three-tier architecture with monitoring enhancements:

*   **Controller (Presentation Layer):** Handles HTTP requests and calls Service layer.
*   **Service (Business Layer):** Core business logic implementation.
*   **Mapper/DAO (Persistence Layer):** MyBatis interfaces for database operations.
*   **Cross-Cutting Concerns:**
    *   `aspect/` - AOP aspects for monitoring and validation
    *   `mq/` - Message queue listeners for asynchronous processing
    *   `config/` - Configuration classes
    *   `utils/` - Utility classes
